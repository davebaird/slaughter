Description: Automation tool to perform system administration remotely
 This package contains a client which will connect to a Slaughter server
 and fetch policies to execute.
 .
 The policies which are executed locally are expressive perl scripts
 with an additional set of helper primitives which allow:
 .
  * Copying files.
 .
  * Manipulating system packages.
 .
  * Executing programs.
 .
  * Sending alerts.
 .
 Unless you wish to initiate execution from the a central location you
 don't need to install the slaughter-server package.
