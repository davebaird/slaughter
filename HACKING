There are two phases of work when slaughter runs:

  1.  Finding out local system information and downloading the
     remote policies.  Both of these jobs are carried out by
     ./bin/slaughter.  Which then wraps the policies in a little perl-fu
     and executes them directly.

  2.  Providing the facilities needed at run-time, this is handled
     via ./lib/Slaughter.pm


If you'd like to make a new variable available to running scripts you'll
need to investigate the slaughter code - see "findSystemDetails".

If you'd like to make a new support function available implement it in
lib/Slaughter/linux.pm, and lib/Slaughter/generic.pm and you should be good to
go.
