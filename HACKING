 There are several phases to an execution of slaughter upon a client
machine:

  - Determine system information.
  - Read configuration file.
  - Parse command line options.
  - Download remote policy.
  - Wrap the policy in a header to make it valid Perl.
  - Execute that wrapped code.
  - Cleanup

 Because the code is wrapped in a little magic the primitives we've provided
are available.  These primitives are nothing more than exported subroutines
which become available due to this in the wrapped file:


    use Slaughter;

 The Slaughter module is a stub which attempts to load the
platform-specific implementations of the subroutines from another
module, via the use of the perl $^O variable.

 So, for example, on a GNU/Linux system "use Slaughter" actually becomes
"use Slaughter::linux".

 If no specific file may be found then the fall-back module
Slaughter::generic is loaded.  This module just print "Not implemented"
for each primitive - see the TODO file for details of this.




System Information
------------------

 When the slaughter client runs it gathers some meta-information about
 the host it is executing upon.

 All the meta-information is gleaned at runtime, by loading a specific
module.  The module must define the single method "MetaInformation" which
will populate a hash-reference.

 You can find sample code in lib/Slaughter/Info/*.pm


Package Installation
--------------------

  TODO:  Move this from:

    ./lib/Slaughter/linux/packages.pm

  to

   ./lib/Slaughter/Packages/linux.pm




Directions
----------

 If you'd like to make a new variable available to running scripts you'll
need to investigate the slaughter code - see "findSystemDetails".

 If you'd like to make a new support function available implement it in
lib/Slaughter/linux.pm, and lib/Slaughter/generic.pm and you should be
good to go.

 The interface to the system's packaging is currently only implemented
for GNU/Linux, via lib/Slaughter/linux/packages.pm.  I'd suggest if you
add support for another platform you follow a similar pattern.
