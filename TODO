Validation
----------

  We want a step 2.5 in this list:

   1.  Get system info.
   2.  Download policies.
   3.  Execute policies.

  To validate policies/whatever.  GPG validation?  Something else?

       e.g. when fetching /default.policy also fetch /default.policy.sig
            and only accept if signature is valid.



Server-Driver
-------------

  * Each client node downloads and schedules itself.  It might be useful
    to accept a request from a location, not necessarily the central policy
    server, to initiate a run.

       e.g. Write a simple service that listens on 1.2.3.4:8888 and when
            a correctly validated request comes in just run "system( slaughter)"

    NOTE:  We then need to think about keys.



Logging
-------

  * Logging has been exorcised from slaughter 2.x - instead output will go
    via mail, assuming we're launched via cron.  This needs to be updated.

    Possible solution is to implement:

        LogMessage( { Message => "This was warning one", Severity => "warning" } );
        LogMessage( { Message => "This was warning two", Severity => "warning" } );
        LogMessage( { Message => "This is a message", Severity => "fatal" } );

    At the end of the run we could have output like this - i.e. sorted by priority:

/--
|        Your script output the following messages:
|
|        Fatal:
|            This is a message.
|
|        Warning:
|            This was warning one.
|            This was warning two.
\--

     This is now pending a commit, but I want to think about it first.  If there
    is no --mail=user@host the output is printed.  If there is a mail address
    specified it is sent there.
