Primitives
----------

  * We use system() when we could use chmod/chown directly.  This is bad.

  * Our primitives are mostly written in pure-perl.  If we made them
    entirely pure-perl we'd be able to drop Slaughter/linux, and
    Slaughter/generic - just merging things together.

    NOTE:  We could and should do this, but the package handling is going to
    be non-portable regardless.

  * Make Slaughter::API::generic a base-class?


Wrapper
-------

  * Add GPG validation for policy download?

       e.g. when fetching /default.policy also fetch /default.policy.sig
            and only accept if signature is valid.


Server-Driver
-------------

  * Each client node downloads and schedules itself.  It might be useful
    to accept a request from a location, not necessarily the central policy
    server, to initiate a run.

       e.g. Write a simple service that listens on 1.2.3.4:8888 and when
            a correctly validated request comes in just run "system( slaughter)"

    NOTE:  We then need to think about keys.


Transport
---------

  * Fetching files via HTTP or HTTPS is simple, clean, and easy to understand.
    Perhaps we might also allow rsync?

    That immediately makes recursive file copies possible, in a way that is
    tricky otherwise.

    Perhaps expect a share:

# rsync.conf
[slaughter]
    path = /path/to/root
    ip acl ..

    Copy this to /var/log/slaughter, and concatenate the policies instead
    of doing the HTTP expansion?

  (Right now a recursive fetch is possible if you were to fetch and unpack
 a .tar file - but that doesn't work well if you want template expansion.)



Logging
-------

  * Logging is simple as the log output from each run is sent to a different
    file, that makes it simple to handle emailing as it reduces the problem
    to mailing the contents of a new file.  However logfiles like this are nasty.

  * Log to a single file, appending, on each run.  Either drop the mailing of
    logfiles or remember where we started to append from?
