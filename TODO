Server-Driver
-------------

  * Each client node downloads and schedules itself.  It might be useful
    to accept a request from a location, not necessarily the central policy
    server, to initiate a run.

       e.g. Write a simple service that listens on 1.2.3.4:8888 and when
            a correctly validated request comes in just run "system( slaughter)"

    NOTE:  We then need to think about keys.
