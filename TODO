Validation
----------

  We want a step 2.5 in this list:

   1.  Get system info.
   2.  Download policies.
   3.  Execute policies.

  To validate policies/whatever.  GPG validation?  Something else?

       e.g. when fetching /default.policy also fetch /default.policy.sig
            and only accept if signature is valid.


Server-Driver
-------------

  * Each client node downloads and schedules itself.  It might be useful
    to accept a request from a location, not necessarily the central policy
    server, to initiate a run.

       e.g. Write a simple service that listens on 1.2.3.4:8888 and when
            a correctly validated request comes in just run "system( slaughter)"

    NOTE:  We then need to think about keys.
