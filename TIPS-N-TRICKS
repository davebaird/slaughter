Persistant Transports
---------------------

Each time you run slaughter on a system it will fetch the files/polices,
from the master, from scratch whether via:

    * git clone ...
    * hg clone ..
    * svn ...
    * rsync ...
    * HTTP-fetch

It isn't obvious to me, yet, if this is a bug or not.  However you
can emulate a persistant transport by cloning your policies onto
each node, and then using the "local" transport.

I do this to ensure that I only ever pull changes, and if that pull
fails there will still be *something* executed.

The rough recipe looks like this:

    * Slaughter is installed upon a host.

    * The initial policies are checked out to /srv/slaughter/ from the
      master location.

    * Slaughter is configured to run via an hourly cronjob with:
            slaughter --transport=local --prefix=/srv/slaughter ...

    * A second cronjob updates /srv/slaughter from the master repostiory
      ensuring new policy changes are implemented.
